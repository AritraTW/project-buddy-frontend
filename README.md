## Team: The Singleton

Project Buddy Dashboard üìäü§ùüí∞
Supercharge your team's performance, retrospectives, and morale with a unified view of key project metrics and peer recognition.

(As of: April 2025)

Retro Buddy Dashboard is a web application designed to provide project teams with a centralized, insightful overview of their sprint performance, work distribution, meeting costs, and team appreciation. It replaces scattered data points and manual tracking with automated visualizations and integrated tools, fostering data-driven decisions, transparency, and a positive team culture.

(Suggestion: Replace the line above with an actual screenshot link once deployed or available)

The Problem It Solves ü§î
Modern project teams often struggle with:

Scattered Information: Sprint data, meeting schedules, costs, and team recognition live in different places (Jira, Calendar, Slack, etc.).
Lack of Visibility: Difficulty getting a quick, clear picture of sprint health, work types, individual contributions, or meeting overhead.
Ineffective Retrospectives: Discussions often rely on memory or subjective feelings rather than objective data.
Under-recognized Contributions: Peer-to-peer appreciation often gets lost in busy channels or isn't tracked effectively.
Manual Reporting Overhead: Time spent manually compiling data for reports and insights.
Retro Buddy Dashboard aims to solve these problems by providing a single, intuitive interface.

Key Features ‚ú®
üìä Velocity Tracking:
Visualize committed vs. completed story points across sprints.
Filter velocity trends by individual team members or view the entire team.
üç∞ Sprint Work Breakdown:
Pie chart showing the distribution of work (Bugs, Features, Chores) for any selected sprint.
Includes a dropdown to easily switch between sprints.
üí° Sprint Insights:
Automated textual insights based on the latest sprint's performance (e.g., warnings for low completion rates, high bug counts).
Provides AI-driven suggestions for potential focus areas.
üë• Team Member Comparison:
Compare the completed points trend for any two team members (or the entire team) across selected sprints.
üí∞ Meeting Cost Awareness:
Calculator: Estimate the cost of a single meeting based on participant rate and duration.
Aggregated View: Analyze historical meeting costs over time (Day, Month, Year).
Filter aggregated costs by Sprint or Milestone (based on calendar event data).
üìÖ Meeting Calendar:
Integrated calendar view displaying scheduled team meetings.
Tooltips show event details and associated costs (if available).
üéâ Kudos Recognition Feed: (Currently Frontend Mock with State)
Dedicated space for peer-to-peer appreciation.
Post kudos with recipient(s), message, tags (Helpfulness, Pairing, Innovation, etc.), and optional anonymity.
Filterable feed by recipient or tag.
Visually engaging card-based display.
How It Impacts Daily Activities üöÄ
Integrating Retro Buddy into a team's workflow provides tangible benefits:

Data-Driven Stand-ups & Planning: Quickly reference velocity and work breakdown trends to inform daily progress and future sprint planning.
More Effective Retrospectives: Use objective data (velocity, completion rates, bug counts, feature output) as talking points, leading to more focused and actionable discussions.
Increased Transparency & Accountability: Everyone can see commitments, progress, and work distribution, fostering a shared understanding and accountability.
Boosted Team Morale: The dedicated Kudos section makes appreciation visible and encourages positive reinforcement, strengthening team bonds.
Improved Cost Consciousness: Visualizing meeting costs prompts discussions about meeting efficiency and necessity.
Reduced Context Switching: Access key project information and team recognition in one place, saving time hunting through different tools.
Enhanced Visibility for Leads/Managers: Provides a quick snapshot of team health, performance trends, and potential bottlenecks.
Why Retro Buddy? The Must-Have Advantages ‚úÖ
All-in-One View: Single pane of glass for critical team information. Stop juggling tools!
Actionable Insights: Go beyond raw data with automated observations and suggestions. Make informed decisions.
Fosters Positive Culture: The integrated Kudos system actively builds morale and recognition. Appreciate your team!
Highly Visual & Interactive: Clear charts and filters make data exploration easy and intuitive.
Reduces Manual Effort: Automate the visualization of common metrics. Save valuable time.
Promotes Transparency: Make key performance and cost indicators accessible and understandable.
Customizable Views: Filters allow teams and individuals to focus on what matters most to them.
Scalability & Org-Wide Implementation Feasibility üåê
Retro Buddy Dashboard is designed with scalability in mind, but implementing it across an organization requires addressing these points:

Data Source Integration (Crucial): The current implementation uses a dummy Node.js API. For real-world use, this backend must be enhanced to connect to actual data sources:
Sprint Data: Integrate with Jira, Azure DevOps, or other project management tool APIs.
Calendar Events: Integrate with Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar APIs.
Kudos Users: Potentially integrate with HR systems or internal directories for accurate recipient lists.
Robust Backend: The dummy API needs to be replaced with a production-grade backend capable of handling concurrent users, managing API integrations securely, and potentially persisting Kudos data.
Authentication & Authorization: Implementing user login (e.g., SSO) and role-based access control is essential to ensure data privacy and appropriate visibility across different teams/roles.
Configuration: Mechanisms will be needed for teams to configure their specific settings (member lists, project keys/IDs, meeting cost rates, calendar sources).
Deployment: Standard web application deployment practices (Docker, Cloud Platforms like AWS/Azure/GCP, CI/CD pipelines) are applicable.
Conclusion: While the frontend provides a strong foundation, realizing org-wide potential requires significant backend development and integration work. However, the modular frontend design makes this feasible.

Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
Frontend:
React (v18+)
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS (for styling)
Recharts (for charts)
React Select (for dropdowns)
React Big Calendar & Moment.js (for calendar view)
React Icons (for icons)
Backend (Dummy API):
Node.js
Express
TypeScript
Cors
Local Setup Instructions üíª
Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. Prerequisites:
* Node.js (LTS version recommended) & npm (or yarn) installed.
* Code Editor (like VS Code).

2. Setup Backend (Dummy API):
* Clone or create the retro-buddy-api directory.
* Navigate into the directory:
  bash cd retro-buddy-api
* Install dependencies:
  bash npm install # or: yarn install
* Run the development server:
  bash npm run dev # or: yarn dev
* (The API should now be running, typically on http://localhost:4000)

3. Setup Frontend:
* Clone or create the my-retro-dashboard directory.
* If creating new, use Vite:
  bash npm create vite@latest my-retro-dashboard -- --template react-ts # or: yarn create vite my-retro-dashboard --template react-ts
* Navigate into the directory:
  bash cd my-retro-dashboard
* Replace the content of src/App.tsx with the final application code provided. Ensure imports/exports match your src/main.tsx.
* Install dependencies:
  bash npm install # or: yarn install
  (This installs React, Recharts, etc. If any dev dependencies are missing from the Vite template, install them: npm install --save-dev @types/react-select @types/react-big-calendar)
* Install and Initialize Tailwind CSS (if not done by template or previous steps):
  bash npm install --save-dev tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer npx tailwindcss init -p
* Configure tailwind.config.js: Ensure the content array includes ./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}.
* Configure src/index.css: Replace content with Tailwind directives (@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;).
* Import Calendar CSS: Add import "react-big-calendar/lib/css/react-big-calendar.css"; in src/main.tsx.
* Run the development server:
  bash npm run dev # or: yarn dev
* (The frontend should now be running, typically on http://localhost:5173)

4. Access: Open the frontend URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173) in your browser. Ensure the backend API is also running.

Future Enhancements üîÆ
Real-time integration with Jira/Azure DevOps.
Real-time integration with Google/Outlook Calendar.
Slack/Teams bot integration for Kudos notifications & posting.
